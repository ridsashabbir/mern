- you have to be patient while learning web development.
- we will be focusing on just html5 here.
- html is not a programming language, it's just a markup language for creating web pages or documents
- why html is not a programming language? because there is no loguc, no conditions, no actual programming, 
  it is just used to display elements of the web page like headings, paragraphs etc. 
- html is a building block of a website.
- does not need a server.
- must have .html extension.
- index.html is the root(home page) of any web page.
