- <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
     <head> </head>
     <body> </body>
  </html>
- DOCTYPE: The HTML document type declaration, also known as DOCTYPE , is the first line of 
  code required in every HTML or XHTML document. The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction 
  to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. This ensures that
  the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.
- head contains title to web page, links to atach external files, metadata etc.
