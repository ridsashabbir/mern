- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet
- css gives style to raw html
- css is used to give style to our web pages
- css is used to make the website responsive
- html to used to structure a website but css takes responsibility of design
- css selectors are used to find or select the html element you want to style
- simple selectors: select elements based on id, name, class
- class is used to group more than one element to style (.)
- id is used to identify a single element (#)
- class selector -> style multiple html elements of same class
- id selector -> style only one html element
- always add css file in the header of html file
- three types of css: inline, external, internal
- inline -> used within the element as <p style = ""></p>
- internal -> add the style tag inside the header
- external -> attach external css file with the help of link in header of html
- inline css is given priority over internal and external css it means if same element is styled in internal and inline css, inline styling will be considered
- link:css a shortcut to add css file in head tag
- use !important if you want any property to take precedence while writing same styling for internal, external or inline css. e.g. if you are giving different colour tp same paragraph in internal, external and inline css, by default inline css' colour will be considered but if you add !important to internal or external css, that colour ill be preffered over internal css.
