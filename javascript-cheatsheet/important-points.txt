- javscript is a general purpose scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript.
- ECMAScipt specification is a blueprint for creating a scripting language.
- standard of javascript (ECMAScript) is also known as ES6.
- javscript is used to create interactive web applications.
- one can execute javascript in browser too.- one can execute javascript code on runtime by installing Node Js in your system.
- another method to execute javascript is by inserting it inside the script tag of html document.
- variable is like a container in which you can store different data types such as string, number, array.
- javascript is a dynamically types language which means you can change the data types of variables on run time.
- three types of variables: let, var, const
- let: variables declared by let are only available inside the block where they are defines.
-let allows you to restrict the scope of variables within the block where they are declared.
- var: variables declared by var are available throughout the function in which they are declared.
- const: if you never want a variable to change, const is the keyword to use.
- reserved keywords cannot be used as vartriable name. 
- with let, you can make block scoped variables. 
- javascript has different data types: primitive and non-primitive
- primitive: set of basic data types from which all other data types are constructed. there are 7 primitive data types(NNSSBBU)
- NNSSBBU: null, number, symbol, string, boolean, bigint, undefined 
- non-primitive data types are derived data types. Objects are non-primitive.
- null is an assigned value, it means nothing, it is primitive
- undefined means a variable has been declared but not defined yet
- objects are just like dictionaries that use in python
- Q: if we consider null as a primitive data type in javascript, then why typeof operator gives us it's type as object? while object is non-primitive, then how null can be categorized as primitive when it's non-primitive and a object?
- A: typeof will print null as a object, it's a bug, originally it's not a object and is primitive
- this keyword refers to the current context
- it is used to access the properties and methods which are part of object
- this keyword always refers to single object and used inside of the function
